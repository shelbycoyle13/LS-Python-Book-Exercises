# In your own words, explain the difference between these two expressions.

# my_object1 == my_object2
# my_object1 is my_object2

The top expression is comparing the equality between the two objects. It's asking "do they have the same value?"

The bottom expression is comparing the identity between the two objects. It's asking "is the first object actually the second object? Do they have the same address in memory? Are they pointing to the same thing?"
