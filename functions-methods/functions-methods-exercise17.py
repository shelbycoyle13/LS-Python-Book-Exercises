# Which of the identifiers in the following program are function names? Which are method names? Which are built-in functions?

# def say(message):             #say = function
#     print(f'==> {message}')   #print = built-in

# string1 = input()             #input = built-in
# string2 = input()             #input = built-in

# say(max(string1.upper(), string2.lower()))    say = function; max = built-in; .upper and .lower are method names
