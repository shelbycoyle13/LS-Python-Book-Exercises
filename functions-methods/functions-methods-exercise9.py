# Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?

# def foo(first, second=3, third=2):
#     print(first)
#     print(second)
#     print(third)

# foo(42, 3.141592, 2.718)

This will print 42, 3.141592, 2.718 because we provided all of the arguments needed. Our arguments get precedence over a default.
