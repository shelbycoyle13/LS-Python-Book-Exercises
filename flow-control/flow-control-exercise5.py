# What does this code output, and why?

# def is_list_empty(my_list):
#     if my_list:
#         print('Not Empty')
#     else:
#         print('Empty')

# is_list_empty([])

Since we provided an empty list as an argument, an empty list is considered Falsy and therefore, prints what is in the else statement, which is 'Empty'
